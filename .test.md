My granny called, she said, "Travvy, you work too hard
I'm worried you forget about me"
(ball ball ball ball)

I'm falling in and out of clouds, don't worry, I'ma get it, Granny, uh
What happened? Now my daddy happy
Mama called me up, that money coming and she love me
I done made it now, I done found life's meaning now
All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
Friends turning into fraud, fraud
Practicing half the passion, you - packaged different
All you -, you - want the swag, you can't have it
I'ma sell it, your - salary, we 'bout to cap, bitch
Youngest - out of Houston at the Grammys
Smiling at 'em laughing at me
I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked, then passed it back
All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin, yeah, yeah
Hm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a four
He passed the cigarette, I choke, whoo
Told my auntie, "Put them 'Ports down, them 'Ports down"
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', -, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these -, I'm styling on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Just this guy from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter, so now a - support a -
